/*
1. Write a pricing algorithm function that takes in a start DateTime, end DateTime, price per hour and returns the total price for the duration.
2. The pricing algorithm should be able to handle the following :
    a. Overwriting the price per hour for a specific DateTime range
    b. Calculating the price by the minute (to account for times when the total time doesn't add up to a full hour)
    c. The algorithm should be timezone aware
3. The price should be doubled on weekends
4. The end of any given day is 23:59:59 & the start of the next day is 00:00:00
5. The price should be rounded to 2 decimal places
6. You may use the library of your choice for date manipulation but DayJS is recommended
7. Use `ts-node pricing_algo` to run the pricing algorithm
